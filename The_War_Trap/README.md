There is software called EUgene

http://eugenesoftware.org/download.asp

that apprently generates data used for this book. But it's shared as
exe (yuck) and the code is written in Pascal for Windows (yuck again).

It seems this researcher created data for his paper

http://www.personal.psu.edu/dsb10/research.htm

which I converted from Stata dta into CSV

Some other data I found on http://www.correlatesofwar.org

Keywords: The War Trap, Bruce Bueno da Mesquita, CSV, data file, f**k Stata, f**k Windows Eugene Code
