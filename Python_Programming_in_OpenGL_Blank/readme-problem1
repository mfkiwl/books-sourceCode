OK ... a lot of Stan's translations of Hippocket 
programs has a design change that seems to be 
non-trivial to back-engineer.

For example Lou Kauffman's Juliaset program. 
In the dynamical systems the dynamical sytems is
drawn directly into the viewable screen (no 
double buffering, therefore no need to store the
trajectories. Therefore you can watch the evolution
and get a motivation for the trails in the dynamical
systems simulated in swapbuffers OpenGL.

But Stan somehow manages to show only the "end result".
I don't know if this is a pedagogical policy, a step
in a construction in the text, or what. An any event,
we want to restore the original concept.
