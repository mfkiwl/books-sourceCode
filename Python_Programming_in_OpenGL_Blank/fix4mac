#from numpy import *    if at all possible
global xx, yy, zz    etc these are changed in calcFoo() and used in viewFoo()
aa= 1; bb=2; cc=3    global parameters used but not changed by functions

in the init() function add
   glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT) to erase the underlying stuff in the buffer
   glClearColor(1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0) if you don't the window to be black

Stan Blank tends to set up the projection matrices here too. It is 
called just before the eternal loop. 

In calcFoo() do all the updates (replacing those long loops)
but declare as global only those that actually get changed here

Since calcFoo() will be in the idle() callback this is as good as any
End calcFoo with    
glutPostRedisplay()   which forces the display callback to be done more
                      than once

In viewFoo() do all the drawing stuff, but no loops, unless you want
    what's in the loop to be finished before drawing. Put the 
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT) here ONLY if you want each drawing to
    be on a blank screen. 
End viewFoo() with
glutSwapBuffers()

Don't forget to change SINGLE to DOUBLE in the main()
