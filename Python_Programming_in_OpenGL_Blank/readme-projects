Here are some ideas for useful projects. 

1. Fly-3D 
The Piet Hut n-body examples are all 3D but have no navigation.
But iceCreamCone, for example, does have the aff-chaptrack 
navigation in it (though no thrusting). It should be a nice 
exercise in the Python extension-by-import feature to build
a module to do this for several non-navigables without having 
to rewrite their codes (too much).  This would become a 
preparation for the ogl.py to szgogl.py bridge for Syzygy.

2. A simpler version of the above would be to do this for a
keyboard() callback to make an escape easier.
