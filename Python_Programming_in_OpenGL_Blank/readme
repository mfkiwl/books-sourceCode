We're in the process of classifying these examples. It's difficult 
to cross check with the .pdf where each eample fits into the pedagogy.

The list "has_psyco" shows which still need their psyco lines removed.
The list "has_chaptrack" rotate, but don't fly.
The list "ls1" shows all current files in this directory in single file.
The "readme-foo" files have commentary. 

In general, those examples with a keyboard() call-back also quit on 
(ESC). Those that don't, may have to be killed "ctl-Z; kill %".
Those which have  chaptrack() only rotate, and are not flyable. 
Many still have aff=[flat array] which bothers the "calculite()".
The cure is to unlatten aff=[[ ],[ ], etc].

These examples belong to Stan Blank's text. But this directory also 
contains other experiments, which you may have to modify to see what
they do.

In particular, all of the require the PyOpenGL Python modules to be 
installed in the particular Python you're using. In Aszgard2010, the
movpy installed there works with these rticas (but only on Windows).

In MacOS and Linux, use a Python version at least 2.5 and intall the 
PyOpenGL bindings of OpenGL. If it still doesn't work, it may be 
by reason of an absence of the Psyco accelation package. This is 
generally no necessary, and you should just comment out the 
relevant lines referring to Psyco.

Compare the sphere called noPscyoGeorge.py with withPsycoGeorge.py. 
(The name is someone else's joke.)
