    "# Two and Three Dimensional Grids\n",

    "In this lesson, we discuss the details of how to extend what we have learned to two and three dimensional grids. Throughout the lessons so far, we have been careful to avoid making too many assumptions that were specific to the fact that the cases were one-dimensional. It is therefore quite straightforward to exend what we have done so far to higher dimensional grids, provided they have an ordered, orthogonal structure.\n",

    "This leads us to a distinction between what are called \"structured\" and \"unstructured\" grids. It is important to note that these labels are primarily associated with how the grid cells are labelled, not their actual topologies (although structured grids are restricted by the topologies that can be represented with structured storage schemes). The figure below shows two identical grids where one is stored as a structured grid (i.e. with ordered row and column labelling) and one that is stored as an unstructured grid (i.e. with arbitrary cell labelling).\n",

This minimizes the size of $\\mathbf{D}_{f,ip}$, which minimizes the size of the gradient correction term, which will be shown below. Also, if the grid happens to be orthogonal, this ensures that $\\mathbf{D}_{f,ip}$ is exactly zero.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the expression above is that the interpolation of $\\phi_{ip}$ depends on the gradient, making this a non-linear system. There are a few solutions to this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ignore the gradients in the calculation of $\\phi_{ip}$ and simply use the inverse distance approximation based on $\\phi_P$ and $\\phi_{nb}$. This is not very accurate, since the gradients will be at most first order accurate. This is the current default behaviour in ANSYS Fluent's \"Green-Gauss Cell-Based\" method (in fact they assume $f_{ip}=0.5$, so the values are not even accurate on an orthogonal grid).\n",
    "- Include the most recent gradients in the calculation of $\\phi_{ip}$, and solve the system iteratively until it converges. This method can be computationally expensive, since the gradients may need to be updated many times. The convergence of this method has been observed to be quite poor (it may diverge easily), so it is not recommended.\n",
    "- Calculate the gradients in multiple stages, first using no gradient corrections. This will give a low-order estimate of the gradients. Then, repeat the process using the first-pass gradients in the correction term. Optionally, the process can be repeated a few times with the previous gradient solution being used in the gradient correction term. For convergence of this method, it is important to always use the gradients from the last complete gradient evaluation. Since the order of update can be quite random, it is better to always use the older values that use some new and some old, which causes instability in the solution. This method is fairly efficient if the number of gradient updates is kept low (e.g. a maximum of two or three updates afer the initial pass). The accuracy is much better than the option of ignoring the gradient correction altogether.\n",

    "### Discretization Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The transient and source terms (including pressure source terms) can be treated similarly to structured grids, since they are volume-based terms. Advection and diffusion terms are surface terms, and therefore must be considered differently for non-orthogonal unstructured grids. These details will be discussed briefly below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advection Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "The discretized advection term from Lesson 1 was given as:\n",
    "\n",

    "    \\int_V \\nabla\\cdot\\left(\\mathbf{u}\\phi\\right) dV \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the value $\\mathbf{u}_{ip}$ is replaced by the advecting velocity $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{ip}$, as discussed Lesson 5. Although it won't be discussed here, a similar definition for $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{ip}$ can be developed for unstructured grids. Interpolation of $\\phi_{ip}$ carries some of the same stability constraints as in one-dimension. Therefore is is common to use a second-order upwind interpolation, defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\phi_{ip} = \\phi_u + \\left.\\nabla\\phi\\right|_u\\cdot\\mathbf{D}_{ip,u}\n",

    "    u = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} P \\text{ if } \\dot{m}_{ip} \\ge 0 \\\\ nb \\text{ if } \\dot{m}_{ip} < 0\\end{matrix} \\right.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearization is carried out with respect to $\\phi_u$, which ensures the linearization coefficients have the correct sign, similar to the UDS scheme discussed previously. There are of course many other possible advection schemes, including CDS and QUICK which can be adapted to general unstructured grids. It should be noted that sometimes a \"flux limiter\" needs to be applied to ensure the integration point value is bounded by the surrounding cell values. This is particularly important for flows with discontinities (e.g. shocks), but is also useful to compensate for the fact that gradients may not always be accurate and could cause unbounded face values to occur.\n",
