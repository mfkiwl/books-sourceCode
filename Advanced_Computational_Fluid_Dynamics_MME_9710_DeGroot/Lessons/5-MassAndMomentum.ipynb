    "## The Problem of Pressure-Velocity Coupling\n",
    "\n",
    "The major issue in solving the mass and momentum equations for an incompressible flow is the fact that pressure does not appear in the conservation of mass equation, since $\\rho$ is a constant. Therefore, the idea of pressure-velocity coupling in the context of an incompressible flow, is that the correct pressures are those which drive the velocities (through the momentum equation) to values that conserve mass. Therefore, the conservation of mass equation can be considered as a constraint equation that can be used in determining the correct pressures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one dimension, specifying the velocity at the inlet allows us to find the velocity at any other location, provided we know the cross-sectional area at that location. The pressures could then be backed out of the momentum equation using these velocities. In two or more dimensions, the situation is not so simple. If, for example, the mass flux through the west face of a two-dimensional control volume were known, we cannot say how that mass flux will be split among the remaining faces. It is the pressures at the surrounding control volumes that determine how the mass is split. The diagram below illustrates the situation:\n",

To clarify, the advecting velocity is the one used in the calculation of the mass flux, while the advected velocity is the one that is multiplied by the mass flux in the advection term.

This will cause less flow into the control volume and more flow out of the control volume, bringing the system closer to conserving mass.\n",

    "After this step is complete, the algorithm would return to Step 1. The corrected pressure $p$ would then become the current best estimate $p*$ for the next iteration. The advecting velocities will have also been corrected (ideally so that they better conserve mass) and the next solution will be closer to the correct solution. This process is repeated until mass is suitably conserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the application of Steps 1-4 replaces one call to the coupled solver, when using the coupled solution approach. The linearization loop still needs to be completed, as well as the time loop (if applicable). During the application of the segregated algorithms for pressure-velocity coupling, the linearization coefficients are not updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the linear system is smaller in the segregated system (just one variable per control volume at a time), if needs to be solved repeatedly. Therefore, selection of the appropriate method often comes down to the stiffness of the coupled linear system, and how difficult it is to solve numerically."

The constant will be equal to $c_p$ when solving the energy equation and equal to 1 when solving momenum. For now we will only consider the first order transient model, since we are focusing mainly on steady-state problems in this lesson (so time accuracy is not important).
