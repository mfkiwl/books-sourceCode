About this Course

Interested in learning how to solve partial differential equations
with numerical methods and how to turn them into python codes? This
course provides you with a basic introduction how to apply methods
like the finite-difference method, the pseudospectral method, the
linear and spectral element method to the 1D (or 2D) scalar wave
equation. The mathematical derivation of the computational algorithm
is accompanied by python codes embedded in Jupyter notebooks. In a
unique setup you can see how the mathematical equations are
transformed to a computer code and the results visualized. The
emphasis is on illustrating the fundamental mathematical ingredients
of the various numerical methods (e.g., Taylor series, Fourier series,
differentiation, function interpolation, numerical integration) and
how they compare. You will be provided with strategies how to ensure
your solutions are correct, for example benchmarking with analytical
solutions or convergence tests. The mathematical aspects are
complemented by a basic introduction to wave physics, discretization,
meshes, parallel programming, computing models.

The course targets anyone who aims at developing or using numerical
methods applied to partial differential equations and is seeking a
practical introduction at a basic level. The methodologies discussed
are widely used in natural sciences, engineering, as well as economics
and other fields.
