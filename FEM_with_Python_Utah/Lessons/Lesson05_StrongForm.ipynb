    "\n",
    "Heat flow in a body occurs when there is a temperature difference within the body. Heat transferred in this way is referred to as conduction.  The heat flow through the wall of a heated room in the winter is an example of conduction.  In this section, the strong form of the differential equation governing heat transfer through conduction will be developed.  Other forms of heat transfer such as convection will be discussed in later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./Images/strong.d/heat-1.png'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a body as shown above. The objective is to determine the temperature distribution. Let $A(x)$ be the area normal to the direction of heat flow and let $s(x)$ be the heat generated per unit thickness of the body, denoted by l. This is often called a heat source. A common example of a heat source is the heat generated in an electric wire due to resistance. In the one-dimensional case, the rate of heat generation is measured in units of energy per time; in SI units, the units of energy are joules (J) per unit length (meters, m) and time (seconds, s). Recall that the unit of power is watts (1 W = 1 J/s). A heat source $s(x)$ is considered positive when heat is generated, i.e. added to the system, and negative when heat is withdrawn from the system. Heat flux, denoted by $q(x)$, is defined as a the rate of heat flow across a surface. Its units are heat rate per unit area; in SI units, W/m$^2$. It is positive when heat flows in the positive x-direction. We will consider a steady-state problem, i.e. a system that is not changing with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To establish the differential equation that governs the system, we consider energy balance in a control volume of the wall. Energy balance requires that the rate of heat energy ($qA$) that is generated in the control volume must equal the heat energy leaving the control volume, as the temperature, and hence the energy in the control volume, is constant in a steady-state problem. The heat energy leaving the control volume is the difference between the flow in at on the left-hand side, $qA$, and the flow out on the right-hand side, $q(x + \\Delta x)A(x+\\Delta x)$. Thus, energy balance for the control volume can be written as\n",
