    "We previously demonstrated how to use weighted residual methods to approximate the solutions to DE. Recall that, in each one of those methods our approximate solution was required to satisfy the boundary conditions of the problem. This becomes increasingly difficult as the problem geometry becomes more complex.  In the finite element method, we divide the complex geometry into a collection of more simplified geometries called *finite elements*, so that we can construct approximate solutions over each element. We then combine the approximate solutions on each element to give a solution for the global problem.  However, we require that the approximate solutions satisfy only the boundary conditions on their respective elements. Thus, the finite element method differs from the weighted residual methods because the approximation functions satisfy only the boundary conditions on a single element and not the whole domain.\n",

Because of the symmetry of the element matrices, the global matrix is also symmetric and one need only store the upper triangle, including the diagonal, in a finite element program. This can save a lot of memory for large systems. Also, since the global matrix $K_{IJ}=0$ if global nodes $I$ and $J$ do not belong to the same element, the global coefficient matrix is banded.\n"
