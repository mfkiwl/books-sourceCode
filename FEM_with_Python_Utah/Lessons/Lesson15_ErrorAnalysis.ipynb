This decision is up to the analyst who presumably knows what a reasonable tolerance is for the problem being solved."

Consider a one-dimension problem for simplicity and suppose that an approximate solution $U_h^P(x)$ has been computed using a polynomial approximation of degree $p$ on a mesh of spacing $h$, as shown above.

In two and three dimensions the cost factors rist to, respectively, four and eight times the solution cost.  Most would consider this to be excessive.  The only way of justifying the procedure is to consider the fine mesh solution as being the result and the coarse mesh solution as furnishing the error estimate.  This strategy only furnishes an error estimate on the coarse mesh."

    "It has been shown that the element size affects the accuracy of your results, but how do we know whether the element sizes associated with a meshed model are fine enough to produce good results?  A simple way to find out is to first model a problem with a certain number of elements and then compare its results to the results of a model with twice as many elements.  If no significant difference between the results of the two meshes is detected, then the meshing is probably alright.  If substantially different results are obtained, then further mesh refinement might be necessary."
