    "Before moving on to the interpolation of the face values, we must consider whether or not the given equation is independent of temperature level (in the absence of source terms) according to Rule 4 given in Lesson 1. It can be argued that it should should be, since the transient, advection, and diffusion terms involve only derivatives of temperature. It can be seen that this should be true, provided mass is conserved (i.e. $\\dot{m}_e = \\dot{m}_w$). This is easy to ensure in one dimension, but more difficult in multidimensional problems. In general, we cannot assure that the numerically computed mass fluxes will always be conservative while the energy equation is being solved. This can cause major problems with the solution process, since the effect of failing to conserve mass would be seen as an apparent energy source (or sink) within the domain.\n",

For large $\\text{Pe}$, the scheme approaches UDS and the scheme can only be considered first order accurate. Therefore, the power law scheme can only be considered as a partial solution. We will not use the power law scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deferred Correction Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach for improving an advection scheme is based on the idea of a \"deferred correction\" where UDS is used as the main advection scheme and linearized accoringly. However, the UDS terms are then also subtracted from the discretized equation and the terms for a higher order scheme are added explicitly. The subtracted UDS terms and the higher order terms are not linearized. Therefore, the linearization maintains the stability of UDS, but the accuracy of the higher order scheme. Once the non-linear iteration is converged, only the higher order terms remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this idea, the advective flux through the east face of a control volume can be written as:\n",

    "where $F_e^{UDS}$ and $F_e^{HOS}$ refer to the flux computed by UDS and the higher order scheme, respectively. As mentioned, linearization is only carried out on the first term in the equation above, since this will guarantee stability of the numerical method.  This does, however, make the linearization inexact (since it is based on the UDS scheme not the higher order scheme). Therefore, iteration is required to arrive at the solution.\n",
