In general, these coefficients could be considered to vary in time, but for the time being they are considered to be independent of time. In this notation, the explicit scheme can be expressed as:\n",

Similarly, this ensures that a drop in $T_P^t$ will cause a a drop in $T_P^{t+\\Delta t}$. Violation of this requirement may cause oscillations in the solution over time, as well as solution instability. In order for this coefficient to remain positive, the timestep must be selected such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\rho c_p V_P}{\\Delta t} \\ge D_e + D_w $$\n",

    "Consider the case of an iron bar with $\\alpha = 23.1 \\times 10^{-6}$ [m$^2$/s] and a spatial grid resolution of $\\Delta x = 0.01$ [m]. In this case the timestep must be less than 2.16 [s]. If the grid sizing is decreased to $\\Delta x = 0.001$ [m], then the timestep restriction becomes 0.0216 [s]. This can result in a fairly significant timestep restriction that gets worse with increasing grid refinement. This is one of the reasons that implicit methods are more commonly used in practice. One exception is the calculation of turbulent flows using direct numerical simulaiton (DNS), which sometimes uses explicit methods, since the timescale must be small anyways to capture the turbulent fluctuations. In this case, explicit methods are a good choice since they are less expensive per timestep than implicit methods, since no linear system must be solved.\n",

    "### Derivation of a Second-Order Implicit Scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "A second-order implicit scheme can be derived by considering integration over a space-time control volume where the 'time faces' are located at times $t-\\Delta t/2$ and $t+\\Delta t/2$. The solution values are stored at times $t$, $t-\\Delta t$, $t-2\\Delta t$, ..., which are in the centre of the time control volume. A schematic diagram of the time control volume is shown below:\n",

    "As a result of the use of a space-time control volume, the right side of the discretized equation, evaluated at $t$, can be considered representative of the entire timestep. This avoids the need to assume a profile in time (i.e. piecewise constant for fully-implicit and fully-explicit and piecewise linear for Crank-Nicholson). This makes coding substantially simpler by avoiding storage of old flux values. Using this method, the interpolation comes when computing the time face values. If we assume piecewise constant, we get a first-order scheme. If we assume piecewise linear, we get a second order scheme.\n",
