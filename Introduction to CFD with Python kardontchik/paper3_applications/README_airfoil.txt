For reference, the original airfoils in the list and new ones added by
Selig are in an x,y format starting from trailing edge, along the upper
surface to the leading edge and back around the lower surface to trailing
edge (e.g., see E205). Lednicer's contributions are upper surface points
leading edge to trailing edge and then lower surface leading edge to
trailing edge (e.g., see Clark Y). Some of the airfoils listed do not
close at the trailing edge, i.e. the trailing edge has a finite thickness
as designed
