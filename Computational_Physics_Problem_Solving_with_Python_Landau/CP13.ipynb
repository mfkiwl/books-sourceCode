    "Filters were discussed in §12.8, where in (12.67) we defined the action\n",

    "*high-resolution* reproductions of signals require more information\n",
    "about details than about gross shape, the pyramid algorithm is an\n",
    "effective way to compress data while still maintaining high resolution.\n",
    "In addition, because components of different resolutions are independent\n",
    "of each other, it is possible to lower the number of data stored by\n",
