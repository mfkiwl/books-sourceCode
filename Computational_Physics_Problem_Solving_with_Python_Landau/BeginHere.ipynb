    ">The more I think of it I find this conclusion more impressed upon me — that the greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to see something, and tell what it saw in a plain way. Hundreds of people can talk for one who can think, but thousands can think for one who can see. <br>- John Ruskin\n",

    "This Python notebook version of *Computational Physics* is the latest realization of our  decades long exploration of models for eTextBooks (see [*Visions and Realizations of a Computational eTextbook*, Computing in Science and Engineering **17(5)**,72-79, August 2015](http://physics.oregonstate.edu/~landaur/Papers/LandauCPbook.pdf)). As the reader of that CiSE article may note, our two biggest struggles have been comingling executable code into publishable text in a legal manor, and  getting publishers to publish some version of our interactive electronic text. The collection of Jupyter/iPython notebooks presented here, with each chapter of our text placed in a separate notebook, represents a big step towards reaching our goal of an \"executable text\".  In addition to  the familiar Web-based multimedia extensions and hyperlinks, the Python version (.ipynb not .html) permits the Python codes to be executed, modified  and produce visualizations as you read the book.  The price paid for executable text is the need to read the book on a computer and within the Jupyter version of a Python environment, although the HTML version of the notebooks can be read in an ordinary browser. (There was also a price to pay in making yet another eBook version, but that's yet another story.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A specific discussion of requisite browsers and media players is given in Section 1.0, along with more ideas about eBooks. A discussion of Python is given below in the *Preface to Printed Third Edition* as well as in *Chapter 1.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The eBook versions of the text  permit an instructor to remove unneeded sections or add their own materials as desired. The authors and publisher Wiley-VCH still maintain copyrights over the materials. We ask that you acknowledge us if you use or modify the materials, and that you respect  all applicable copyright laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "The codes in the notebooks are essentially identical to those in the paper text, with the biggest change being the need to replace the paper text's use of the *Visual* package by the *iVisual* package designed for notebooks. No change is needed for those codes that use *MatPlotLib* (which is similar to *MatLab* graphics). This is our first use of the notebook format and so some parts may not be as well done as possible. We welcome suggestions for the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, and in deep sadness, we must note that the junior member of the coauthors, Cristian Bordeianu, passed away just as the paper version of the third edition was coming out. We miss him terribly and dedicate this version to the memory of his contributions and especially his friendship.\n",

    "Páez’s *Computational Physics* and seven years since Cristian Bordeianu\n",
    "joined the collaboration for the second edition. This third edition\n",
    "adheres to the original philosophy that the best way to learn\n",
    "computational physics (CP) is by working on a wide range of projects\n",
    "using the text and the computer as partners. Most projects are still\n",
    "constructed using a computational, scientific problem-solving paradigm:\n",
    " Our guiding hypothesis remains that CP is a\n",
    "computational science, which means that to understand CP you need to\n",
    "understand some physics, some applied mathematics and some computer\n",
    "science. What’s different in this edition is the choice of Python for\n",
    "sample codes and an increase in the number of topics covered. We now\n",
    "have a survey of CP which is more than enough for a full-year’s course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of Python is more than just a change of language, it is taking\n",
    "advantage of the Python ecosystem of base language plus multiple,\n",
    "specialized libraries to provide all computational needs. In addition,\n",
    "we find Python to be the easiest and most accessible language for\n",
    "beginners, while still being excellent for the type of interactive and\n",
    "exploratory computations now popular in scientific research.\n",
    "Furthermore, Python supplemented by the Visual package (Vpython) has\n",
    "gained traction in lower-division physics teaching, and this may serve\n",
    "as an excellent segue to a Python-based CP course. Nevertheless, the\n",
    "important aspects of computational modeling and thinking transcends any\n",
    "particular computer language, and so having a Python alternative to our\n",
    "previous use of Fortran, C and Java may help promote this view (codes in\n",
    "all languages are available).\n",

    "As before, we advocate for the use of a compiled or interpreted\n",
    "programming language when learning CP, in contrast to a higher-level\n",
    "problem-solving environment like Mathematica or Maple, which we use in\n",
    "daily work. This follows from our experiences that if you want to\n",
    "*understand* how to compute scientifically, then you must look inside a\n",
    "program’s black box and get your hands dirty. Otherwise, the algorithms,\n",
    "logic and the validity of solutions cannot be ascertained, and that is\n",
    "not a good physics. Not surprisingly, we believe all physicists should\n",
    "know how to read programs how to write them as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notwithstanding our beliefs about programming, we appreciate how\n",
    "time-consuming and frustrating debugging programs often is, and\n",
    "especially for beginners. Accordingly, rather than make the learner\n",
    "write all codes from scratch, we have placed a large number of codes\n",
    "within the text and often ask the learner only to run, modify, and\n",
    "extend them. This not only leaves time for exploration and analysis, but\n",
    "also provides experience in the modern work environment in which one\n",
    "must incorporate new developments into the preexisting codes of others.\n",
    "Be that as it may, for this edition we have added problems in which the\n",

    "online. They may provide avenues for alternative understanding the text\n",
    "(either as a preview or a review), for an online course, or for a\n",

    "latter approach, which we recommend, provides time for the instructor to\n",
