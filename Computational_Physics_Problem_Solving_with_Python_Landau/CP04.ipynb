After discussing how computers generate pseudorandom numbers, we explore how these numbers are used to incorporate the element of chance into   simulations.   We do this first by simulating a random walk and then by simulating the spontaneous decay of an atom or nucleus. In [Chapter 5](#CP05.ipynb)  we   show how to use these random numbers to evaluate integrals, and in [Chapter 17](#CP17.ipynb), *Thermodynamic Simulations & Feynman Path Integrals*, we investigate the use of random numbers to simulate thermal processes  and the fluctuations inherent in  quantum systems.*\n",

    "## 4.4 Extension: Protein Folding & Self-Avoiding Random Walks<a id=\"4.4\"> </a> <a name=\"sec.folding\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A protein is a large biological molecule made up of molecular chains (the residues of amino acids). These chains are formed from *monomers*, that is, molecules that bind chemically with other molecules. More specifically, these  chains consist  of non-polar hydrophobic (H) monomers that are repelled by water, and polar (P) monomers that are attracted by water. The actual structure of a protein results from a *folding process* in which random coils of chains rearrange themselves into a configuration of minimum energy. We want to model that process on the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although molecular dynamics [(Chapter 18)](#chap.MD) may be used to simulate protein folding, it is much slower than Monte-Carlo techniques, and even then, it is hard to find the lowest energy states. Here we   create a simple Monte-Carlo simulation in which you to take a random walk in a 2-D square lattice \\[[Yue(04)](BiblioLinked.html#folding)\\].  At the end of each step, you randomly choose  an H or a P monomer and drop it on the lattice, with your choice weighted such that H monomers are more likely than P ones. The walk is restricted such that the only positions available after each step are the three neighboring sites, with the already-occupied sites  excluded (this is why this technique  is known as a *self-avoiding random walk*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the simulation is to find the lowest energy state of an HP sequence of various lengths. These then may be compared to those in nature. Just how best to find such a state is an active research topic \\[[Yue *et al.*, 2004](BiblioLinked.html#folding)\\]. The energy of a chain is defined as\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is a positive constant and $f$  is the number of H-H neighbor *not* connected directly (P-P and H-P bonds do not count at lowering the energy). So if the neighbor next to an H is another H, it lowers the energy, but if it is a P it does not lower the energy. We show a typical simulation result in [Figure 4.5](#fig.fold), where a yellow dot is placed half way between two H (red-dot) neighbors.  Accordingly, for a given length of chain, we expect the natural state(s) of an H-P sequence to be those with the largest possible number $f$ of H-H contacts.  That is what we are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps in Folding Simultation <a name=\"ex.folding\"></a>\n",
    "1. Modify the random walk program we have already developed so that it simulates a self-avoiding random walk. The key here is that the walk stops at a corner, or when there are no empty neighboring sites available.\n",
    "1. Make a random choice as to whether the monomer is an H or a P, with a weighting such that there are more H's than P's.\n",
    "1. Produce a visualization that shows the positions occupied by the monomers, with the    H and P monomer indicated by different color dots. (Our visualization, shown in [Figure 4.5](#fig.fold), is produced by the program `ProteinFold.py`, available on the Instructor's site.)\n",
    "1. After the walk ends, record the energy and length of the chain.\n",
    "1. Run many folding simulations and save the outputs, categorized by length and energy.\n",
    "1. Examine the state(s)   of lowest energy for    various chain lengths and compare the results to those from molecular dynamic simulations and actual protein structures (available on the Web).\n",
