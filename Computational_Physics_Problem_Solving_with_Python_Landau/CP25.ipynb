    "We assume that the submerged parallel plates are placed in a stream that\n",

    "(Figure 25.1 right). If the velocity $V_0$ is not too high or the\n",

    "fluid. These streamlines can be visualized experimentally by adding\n",

    "the solution space, at the *outlet* where it leaves, and at the\n",

    "stream’s bottom and surface, we assume that the dotted-dashed centerline\n",

    "assume that there is a physical outlet at the end with the water just\n",
    "shooting out of it. Consequently, we assume that the water pressure\n",
