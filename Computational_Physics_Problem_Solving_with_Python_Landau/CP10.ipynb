    "An idealized model of computer architecture is a CPU sequentially\n",
    "executing a stream of instructions and reading from a continuous block\n",
    "of memory. To illustrate, in Figure 10.1 we have a vector `A[ ]` and an\n",
    "array `M[.. , .. ]` loaded in memory and about to be processed. The real\n",
    "world is more complicated than this. First, arrays are not stored in 2-D\n",
    "blocks, but rather in linear order. For instance, in Python, Java and C\n",

    "\n",
    "Second, as illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, the values for the matrix\n",
    "elements may not even be in the same physical place. Some may be in RAM,\n",
    "some on the disk, some in cache, and some in the CPU. To give these\n",
    "words more meaning, in Figures 10.3 and 10.2 we show simple models of\n",
    "the memory architecture of a high-performance computer. This\n",
    "hierarchical arrangement arises from an effort to balance speed and\n",
    "cost, with fast, expensive memory supplemented by slow, less expensive\n",
    "memory. The memory architecture may include the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](Figs/Fig10_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 10.2** Typical memory hierarchy for a single-processor,\n",
    "high-performance computer (B = bytes, K, M, G, T = kilo, mega, giga, tera).\n",
    "\n",
    "**CPU:**\n",
    "Central processing unit, the fastest part of the computer. The CPU\n",
    "consists of a number of very-high-speed memory units called *registers*\n",
    "containing the *instructions* sent to the hardware to do things like\n",
    "fetch, store, and operate on data. There are usually separate registers\n",
    "for instructions, addresses, and *operands* (current data) In many cases\n",
    "the CPU also contains some specialized parts for accelerating the\n",
    "processing of floating-point numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cache:**\n",
    "A small, very fast bit of memory that holds instructions, addresses, and\n",
    "data in their passage between the very fast CPU registers and the\n",
    "slower RAM. (Also called a high-speed buffer.) This is seen in the next\n",
    "level down the pyramid in Figure 10.2. The main memory is also called\n",
    "*dynamic RAM* (DRAM), while the cache is called *static RAM* (SRAM). If\n",
    "the cache is used properly, it can greatly reduce the time that the CPU\n",
    "waits for data to be fetched from memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cache lines:**\n",
    "The data transferred to and from the cache or CPU are grouped into cache\n",
    "or data lines. The time it takes to bring data from memory into the\n",
    "cache is called *latency*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAM:**\n",
    "Random-access or central memory is in the middle of the memory hierarchy\n",
    "in Figure 10.2. RAM is fast because its addresses can be accessed\n",
    "directly in random order, and because no mechanical devices are needed\n",
    "to read it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pages:**\n",
    "Central memory is organized into pages, which are blocks of memory of\n",
    "fixed length. The operating system labels and organizes its memory pages\n",
    "much like we do the pages of a book; they are numbered and kept track of\n",
    "with a *table of contents*. Typical page sizes range from 4 to 16 kB,\n",
    "but on supercomputers they may be in the MB range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hard disk:**\n",
    "Finally, at the bottom of the memory pyramid is permanent storage on\n",
    "magnetic disks or optical devices. Although disks are very slow compared\n",
    "to RAM, they can store vast amounts of data and sometimes compensate for\n",
    "their slower speeds by using a cache of their own, the *paging storage\n",
    "controller*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Virtual memory:**\n",
    "True to its name, this is a part of memory you will not find in our\n",
    "figures because it is *virtual*. It acts like RAM but resides on\n",
    "the disk.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Figure 10.3** The elements of a computer’s memory architecture in the\n",
    "process of handling matrix storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we speak of “fast” and “slow” memory we are using a time scale set\n",
    "by the clock in the CPU. To be specific, if your computer has a clock\n",
    "speed or cycle time of 1 ns, this means that it could perform a billion\n",
    "operations per second, if it could get its hands on the needed data\n",
    "quickly enough (typically, more than 10 cycles are needed to execute a\n",
    "single instruction). While it usually takes 1 cycle to transfer data\n",
    "from the cache to the CPU, the other types of memories are much slower.\n",
    "Consequently, you can speed up your program by having all needed data\n",
    "available for the CPU when it tries to execute your instructions;\n",
    "otherwise the CPU may drop your computation and go on to other chores\n",
    "while your data gets transferred from lower memory (we talk more about\n",
    "this soon in the discussion of pipelining or cache reuse). Compilers try\n",
    "to do this for you, but their success is affected by your programming\n",
    "style.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in Figure 10.3, virtual memory permits your program to use more\n",
    "pages of memory than can physically fit into RAM at one time. A\n",
    "combination of operating system and hardware *maps* this virtual memory\n",
    "into pages with typical lengths of 4-16 kB. Pages not currently in use\n",
    "are stored in the slower memory on the hard disk and brought into fast\n",
    "memory only when needed. The separate memory location for this switching\n",
    "is known as *swap space* (Figure 10.5 A).\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that when an application accesses the memory location for\n",
    "`M[i,j]`, the number of the page of memory holding this address is\n",
    "determined by the computer, and the location of `M[i,j]` within this\n",
    "page is also determined. A *page fault* occurs if the needed page\n",
    "resides on disk rather than in RAM. In this case the entire page must be\n",
    "read into memory while the least recently used page in RAM is swapped\n",
    "onto the disk. Thanks to virtual memory, it is possible to run programs\n",
    "on small computers that otherwise would require larger machines (or\n",
    "extensive reprogramming). The price you pay for virtual memory is an\n",
    "order-of-magnitude slowdown of your program’s speed when virtual memory\n",
    "is actually invoked. But this may be cheap compared to the time you\n",
    "would have to spend to rewrite your program so it fits into RAM, or the\n",
    "money you would have to spend to buy enough RAM for your problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual memory also allows *multitasking*, the simultaneous loading into\n",
    "memory of more programs than can physically fit into RAM (Figure 10.5\n",
    "A). Although the ensuing switching among applications uses computing\n",
    "cycles, by avoiding long waits while an application is loaded into\n",
    "memory, multitasking increases the total throughout and permits an\n",
    "improved computing environment for users. For example, it is\n",
    "multitasking that permits a windowing system, such as Linux, Apple OS or\n",
    "Windows, to provide us with multiple windows. Although each window\n",
    "application uses a fair amount of memory, only the single application\n",
    "currently receiving input must actually reside in memory; the rest are\n",
    "*paged out* to disk. This explains why you may notice a slight delay\n",
    "when switching to an idle window; the pages for the now-active program\n",
    "are being placed into RAM, and the least used application still in\n",
    "memory is simultaneously being paged out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.3  The Central Processing Unit<a id=\"10.3\"></a> \n",
    "\n",
    "How does the CPU get to be so fast? Often, it utilizes *prefetching* and\n",
    "*pipelining*; that is, it has the ability to prepare for the next\n",
    "instruction before the current one has finished. It is like an assembly\n",
    "line or a bucket brigade in which the person filling the buckets at one\n",
    "end of the line does not wait for each bucket to arrive at the other end\n",
    "before filling another bucket. In the same way a processor fetches,\n",
    "reads, and decodes an instruction while another instruction is\n",
    "executing. Consequently, despite the fact that it may take more than one\n",
    "cycle to perform some operations, it is possible for data to be entering\n",
    "and leaving the CPU on each cycle. To illustrate, Table 10.1 indicates\n",
    "how the operation *c* = (*a* + *b*)/(*d* × *f*) is handled. Here the\n",
    "pipelined arithmetic units A1 and A2 are simultaneously doing their jobs\n",
    "of fetching and operating on operands, yet arithmetic unit A3 must wait\n",
    "for the first two units to complete their tasks before it has something\n",
    "to do (during which time the other two sit idle).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Reduced instruction set computer* (RISC) architecture (also called\n",
    "*superscalar*) is a design philosophy for CPU’s developed for\n",
    "high-performance computers and now used broadly. It increases the\n",

    "CPU must follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "with CISC, *complex instruction set computer* architecture. In the late\n",
    "1970s, processor designers began to take advantage of *very-large-scale\n",
    "integration* (VLSI), which allowed the placement of hundreds of\n",
    "thousands of elements on a single CPU chip. Much of the space on these\n",
    "early chips was dedicated to *microcode* programs written by chip\n",
    "designers and containing machine language instructions that set the\n",
    "operating characteristics of the computer. instructions available, and\n",
    "many were similar to higher-level programming languages such as *Pascal*\n",
    "and *Forth*. The price paid for the large number of complex instructions\n",
    "was slow speed, with a typical instruction taking more than 10 clock\n",
    "cycles. Furthermore, a 1975 study by Alexander and Wortman of the *XLP*\n",
    "compiler of the IBM System/360 showed that about 30 low-level\n",
    "instructions accounted for 99% of the use with only 10 of these\n",
    "instructions accounting for 80% of the use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RISC philosophy is to have just a small number of instructions\n",
    "available at the chip level but to have the regular programmer’s high\n",
    "level-language, such as Fortran or C, translate them into efficient\n",
    "machine instructions for a particular computer’s architecture. This\n",
    "simpler scheme is cheaper to design and produce, lets the processor run\n",
    "faster, and uses the space saved on the chip by cutting down on\n",
    "microcode to increase arithmetic power. Specifically, RISC increases the\n",
    "number of internal CPU registers, thus making it possible to obtain\n",
    "longer pipelines (cache) for the data flow, a significantly lower\n",
    "probability of memory conflict, and some instruction-level parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory behind this philosophy for RISC design is the simple equation\n",
    "describing the execution time of a program:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tag*{10.3} {\\rm CPU\\ time = number\\ of\\ instructions\\ \\times\n",
    "cycles/instruction\n",
    "\\times cycle\\ time .}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here “CPU time” is the time required by a program, “number of\n",
    "instructions” is the total number of machine-level instructions the\n",
    "program requires (sometimes called the *path length*),\n",
    "“cycles/instruction” is the number of CPU clock cycles each instruction\n",
    "requires, and “cycle time” is the actual time it takes for one CPU\n",
    "cycle. After thinking about (10.3), we can understand the CISC\n",
    "philosophy that tries to reduce CPU time by reducing the number of\n",
    "instructions, as well as the RISC philosophy, which tries to reduce the\n",
    "CPU time by reducing cycles/instruction (preferably to 1).For RISC to\n",
    "achieve an increase in performance requires a greater decrease in cycle\n",
    "time and cycles/instruction than is the increase in the number of\n",
