    "\\[[Mandelbrot(82)](BiblioLinked.html#mandel)\\]. Some geometric objects, such as Koch curves, are\n",
    "exact fractals with the same dimension for all their parts. Other\n",
    "objects, such as bifurcation curves, are statistical fractals in which\n",
    "elements of apparent randomness occur and the dimension can be defined\n",
    "only for each part of the object, or on the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an abstract object such as the density of charge within an\n",
    "atom. There are an infinite number of ways to measure the “size” of this\n",
    "object. For example, each moment $\\langle r^n\n",
    "\\rangle$ is a measure of the size, and there is an infinite number of\n",
    "such moments. Likewise, when we deal with complicated objects, there are\n",
    "different definitions of dimension and each may give a somewhat\n",
    "different value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first definition of the dimension $d_f$, the *Hausdorff-Besicovitch\n",
