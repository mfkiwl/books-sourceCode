    "A powerful feature of NumPy is its high-level *vectorization*. This is\n",
    "the process in which the single call of a function operates not on a\n",

    "computers follow along the same lines as we have been discussing, but\n",
    "with an even greater emphasis on minimizing communication costs\\[*Note:*\n",
    "Much of the material in this section comes from talks by John Dongarra\n",
    "\\[Dongarra(11)\\].\\]. Contrary to the traditional view on optimization,\n",
    "this means that the “faster” of two algorithms may be the one that takes\n",

    "programming the GPU directly can be quite high, many application\n",

    "GPU. But if you must, here’s how.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exascale computers and computing are expected to be *“disruptive\n",

    "for computers and computing. This is in contrast to the more evolving\n",

    "our applications), much as it did when supercomputers changed from large\n",
    "vector machines with proprietary CPU’s to cluster computers using\n",
    "commodity CPU’s and message passing. Here are some of the major points\n",
    "to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exacascale data movement is expensive\n",
    "\n",
    ":   The time for a floating-point operation and for a data transfer can\n",
    "    be similar, although if the transfer is not local, as Figures 10.12\n",
    "    and 10.14 show happens quite often, then communication will be the\n",
    "    rate-limiting step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exacascale flops are cheap and abundant\n",
    "\n",
    ":   GPU’s and local multicore chips provide many, very fast flops for us\n",
    "    to use, and we can expect even more of these elements to be included\n",
    "    in future computers. So do not worry about flops as much\n",
    "    as communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronization-reducing algorithms are essential\n",
    "\n",
    ":   Having many processors stop in order to synchronize with each other,\n",
    "    while essential in ensuring that the proper calculation is being\n",
    "    performed, can slow down processing to a halt (literally). It is\n",
    "    better to find or derive an algorithm that reduces the need\n",
    "    for synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Break the fork-join model\n",
    "\n",
    ":   This model for parallel computing takes a queue of incoming jobs,\n",
    "    divides them into subjobs for service on a variety of servers, and\n",

    "    of model can lead to completed subjobs on various parts of the\n",
    "    computer that must wait for other subjobs to complete\n",

    ":   As already discussed, it is best to use methods that lessen the need\n",

    "    precision calculation, or when made to move double-precision data.\n",
    "    The preferred approach then is to use single precision. One way to\n",
    "    do this is to utilize perturbation theory in which the calculation\n",
    "    focuses on the small (single precision) correction to a known, or\n",
    "    separately calculated, large (double precision) basic solution. The\n",
    "    rule-of-thumb then is to use the lowest precision required to\n",
    "    achieve the required accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Push for and use autotuning\n",
    "\n",
    ":   The computer manufactures have advanced the hardware to incredible\n",
    "    speeds, but have not produced concordant advances in the software\n",
    "    that scientists need to utilize in order to make good use of\n",

    "    that not many scientists can afford. We need smarter software to\n",

    "\n",
    ":   a part or parts of a program that are executed in parallel by the\n",

    "    on the *device* (another term for the GPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread:\n",
    "\n",
    ":   the basic element of data to be processed on the GPU. Sometimes\n",
    "    defined as an execution of a kernel with a given index, or the\n",
    "    abstraction of a function call acting on data. The numbers of\n",
    "    threads that are able to run concurrently on a GPU depends upon the\n",
    "    specific hardware being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Index:\n",
    "\n",
    ":   All threads see the same kernel, but each kernel is executed with a\n",
    "    different parameter or subscript, called an index.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a working example, consider the summation of the arrays `a` and `b`\n",
    "by a kernel with the result assigned to the array `c`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tag*{11.11}\n",
