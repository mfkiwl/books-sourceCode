# CFD codes based on textbooks

CFD codes written based on examples in various books like Patnakar,
Versteeg etc.

These books present some of the fundamentals of computational fluid
mechanics. They provide a thorough yet user-friendly introduction to
the governing equations and boundary conditions of viscous fluid
flows, turbulence and its modelling, and the finite volume method of
solving flow problems on computers.
