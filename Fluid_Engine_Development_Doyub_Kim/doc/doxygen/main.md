Jet framework is a fluid simulation engine SDK for computer graphics applications that was created by Doyub Kim as part of the book, ["Fluid Engine Development"](https://www.crcpress.com/Fluid-Engine-Development/Kim/p/book/9781498719926). The code is built on C++11 and can be compiled with commonly available compilers such as g++, clang, and Visual Studio. Currently tested platforms are macOS (10.10 or later), Ubuntu (14.04 or later), and Windows (Visual Studio 2015).

### Key Features
* SPH and PCISPH fluid simulators
* Stable fluids-based smoke simulator
* Level set-based liquid simulator
* PIC and FLIP fluid simulators
* Upwind, ENO and FMM level set solvers
* Converters between signed distance function and triangular mesh

Every simulator has both 2-D and 3-D implementations.
